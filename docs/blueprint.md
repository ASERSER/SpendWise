# **App Name**: SpendWise

## Core Features:

- Quick Expense Logging: Log expenses quickly with a streamlined, amount-first interface.
- Daily Reminders: Set up daily reminders to log expenses at a chosen time.
- Spending Overview: View spending by category, monthly trends, and account balances.
- Budget Management: Set monthly budgets (tool), per category or overall, and receive alerts. An AI tool might incorporate reasoning to determine if the user has entered all required budget parameters, or if any entered parameters exceed reasonable ranges
- Account & Currency Management: Manage multiple accounts (cash, card, bank) and track expenses in different currencies.
- Search & Export: Filter and search transactions; export data to CSV.
- Offline & Private: Offline-first design ensures expenses and data are private and secure by default; no accounts, no ads, data only kept on the user's device.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF), lending a trustworthy and confident feel.  (Chosen because the prompt refers to an intention to build something "trustworthy.")
- Background color: Very light blue (#F7F8FA), maintaining the calm vibe, but making it visually distinct from pure white.
- Accent color: Purple (#8856FF), adding visual interest to UI elements like charts or interactive components.
- Font: 'SF Pro' (sans-serif) to match the iOS-native look and feel (per the user request). Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Icons: SF Symbols outlined style for a clean, minimalist design (also per the user request for a design matched to SwiftUI).
- Amount-first layout, ensuring easy one-thumb use in accordance with the spec (easy to reach amount first).
- Springy animations for sheets and FAB; subtle haptics on save.
